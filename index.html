        It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George's
        Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners,
        unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in
        such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and
        bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village, while the
        Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns,
        stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came
        unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed.
